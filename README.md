# **Sentiment Analysis of Top 25 Financial News**

**Description**

This project delves into the sentiment analysis of the top 25 financial news articles. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in these articles. This can provide valuable insights into market trends and investor confidence.

**Libraries Used**

* NumPy (np): Provides efficient numerical computations.
* Pandas (pd): Offers high-performance data structures (DataFrames and Series) for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib.pyplot (plt): Creates various visualizations like plots, charts, and histograms.
* Scikit-learn:
    * CountVectorizer: Transforms text data into numerical feature vectors.
    * train_test_split: Splits data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
    * RandomForestClassifier: Implements the Random Forest machine learning algorithm for classification.
    * classification_report: Generates a classification report summarizing model performance.
    * confusion_matrix: Visualizes the performance of the classification model on a per-class basis.
    * accuracy_score: Calculates the accuracy of the model's predictions.

**Steps**

1. **Import Necessary Libraries:**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
   ```

2. **Define the Data Source:**
   - You'll need to specify how you'll be obtaining the top 25 financial news articles. Here are some options:
     - Web scraping using libraries like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy.
     - APIs from financial news providers.
   - Replace this placeholder with your chosen method:

   ```python
   # Replace with your data acquisition method (e.g., web scraping or API)
   data = pd.read_csv('financial_news.csv')  # Assuming CSV format
   ```

3. **Import the Data into a DataFrame:**
   - The code snippet you provided assumes the data is already in a CSV file named `financial_news.csv`. If you're using a different format or data acquisition method, adapt the code accordingly.

4. **Describe the Dataset:**
   - Get basic information about the data (number of rows, columns, data types, missing values, etc.) using `data.info()`, `data.describe()`, and other pandas methods.

5. **Visualize Important Features:**
   - Create visualizations (histograms, boxplots, etc.) to explore the distribution of sentiment labels or other relevant features. This helps identify patterns and potential areas for preprocessing.
   - Use `plt.hist()`, `sns.boxplot()`, or other plotting functions from Matplotlib or Seaborn.

6. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the text data (remove punctuation, stop words, lowercase conversion, etc.) using regular expressions or libraries like NLTK.
   - Consider stemming or lemmatization to normalize words to their base form.
   - You might need to handle missing values (e.g., impute or remove rows/columns).

7. **Defining Target Variables and Feature Vector:**
   - Create a target variable representing the sentiment (e.g., a new column with labels like 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral').
   - Use `CountVectorizer` to transform the text data into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning models.

8. **Train and Test Data Split:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`. The training set will be used to train the model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

9. **Find a Machine Learning Model:**
   - Train a Random Forest Classifier model using `RandomForestClassifier()`. You can experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, maximum depth) to improve performance.

10. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Use `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix` to assess the model's performance on the testing set. These metrics provide insights into precision, recall, F1-score, and how well the model is classifying different sentiment classes.
   - Calculate `accuracy_score` to measure the overall accuracy of the model's predictions.

11. **Make Necessary Predictions:**

   - Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to predict the sentiment of new financial news articles. Here's an example:

   ```python
   # Assuming your model is named 'model' and you have a new article in a variable 'new_article'
   new_prediction = model.predict([new_article])
   print(f"Predicted sentiment for the new article: {new_prediction[0]}")
   ```

12. **Find the Accuracy Scores to Measure the Performance:**

   - The `accuracy_score` function you already imported can be used to calculate the overall accuracy of the model on the testing set:

   ```python
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))
   print(f"Model accuracy on testing set: {accuracy:.4f}")
   ```

**Running the Colab Notebook**

1. Create a new Colab notebook on [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the Python script for this project (along with any required data files) to your Colab notebook environment.
3. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed by running `!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn` in a code cell (the exclamation mark indicates a shell command).
4. Run the code cells in your script one by one to execute the sentiment analysis steps.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Error Handling:** Incorporate error handling mechanisms (e.g., `try-except` blocks) to gracefully handle potential issues during data acquisition, preprocessing, or model training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explore hyperparameter optimization techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from scikit-learn to fine-tune the Random Forest model's performance.
- **Alternative Models:** Consider experimenting with other machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sentiment analysis, especially if you're dealing with more complex textual data.
- **Deployment:** If you intend to deploy this project as a web application or API, explore frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to create a user-friendly interface for sentiment analysis.
